# Millicast Android SDK Sample Apps

Starting off this is for : https://jira.dolby.net/jira/browse/DIOS-5387

It could be used to replace https://github.com/CoSMoSoftware/Millicast-Java-SDK-Android-Sample-App-in-Java

As such it should be written to a public standard even though it's in a private repo right now.

We're also going to write it for 1.8.4 initially, instead of 1.9.0

The Native SDK should be built and published locally for now from the 1.8 branch.

Has Spotless included.
